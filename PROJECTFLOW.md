## 📊 Detailed Token Lifecycle Flow

### Phase 1: Token Creation & Bonding Curve Trading

#### 1.1 Token Creation Process
```solidity
// User calls createMeme() with metadata and pays 0.002 Yellow Network tokens
function createMeme(
    string calldata _name,        // Token name
    string calldata _ticker,      // Token symbol
    string calldata _description, // Token description
    string calldata _image        // Token image URL
) public payable
```

**What Happens Under the Hood:**
1. **Fee Validation**: System checks if user sent ≥ 0.002 Yellow Network tokens
2. **Token Deployment**: New `MemedToken` contract deployed with provided metadata
3. **State Initialization**: Token enters `BOUNDING_CURVE` stage with:
   - Transfer restrictions enabled (can't transfer until graduation)
   - Zero collateral initially
   - Creation timestamp recorded
4. **Fee Collection**: Creation fee added to platform's fee balance
5. **Event Emission**: `TokenCreated` event with all token details

#### 1.2 Bonding Curve Trading Mechanics

**Price Calculation Algorithm:**
```solidity
function getYellowAmount(address _token, uint256 _amount) public view returns (uint256[3] memory) {
    MemedToken token = MemedToken(_token);
    uint256 currentSupply = token.totalSupply();
    uint256 newSupply = currentSupply + _amount;
    uint256 f_b = k * newSupply + offset;  // Linear bonding curve
    uint256 result = ((_amount * f_b) / SCALING_FACTOR);
    uint256 fee = (result * tradeFeePercent) / 10000;  // 10% fee
    return [result - fee, result, fee];  // [netAmount, totalAmount, fee]
}
```

**Key Parameters:**
- **k = 1**: Linear bonding curve coefficient
- **offset = 0**: No initial price offset
- **SCALING_FACTOR = 10^28**: Precision scaling for price calculations
- **tradeFeePercent = 10**: 10% trading fee

**Price Discovery Process:**
1. **Initial Price**: Very low (near zero) when supply is minimal
2. **Price Increase**: Linear increase as supply grows
3. **Fee Structure**: 10% fee on all trades (buy/sell)
4. **Collateral Accumulation**: All Yellow Network tokens from trades accumulate as collateral

#### 1.3 Buy/Sell Mechanics

**Buy Process:**
```solidity
function buy(address _token, uint256 _amount) public payable
```

**Step-by-Step Buy Flow:**
1. **Validation**: Check token is in `BOUNDING_CURVE` stage
2. **Price Calculation**: Calculate required Yellow Network tokens using bonding curve
3. **Fee Calculation**: 10% fee deducted from total price
4. **Token Minting**: New tokens minted to buyer's address
5. **Collateral Update**: Total price (including fee) added to token's collateral
6. **Excess Refund**: Any excess Yellow Network tokens refunded to buyer
7. **Graduation Check**: If collateral ≥ 0.005 Yellow Network tokens, trigger graduation

**Sell Process:**
```solidity
function sell(address _token, uint256 _amount) public
```

**Step-by-Step Sell Flow:**
1. **Validation**: Check token stage and user balance
2. **Price Calculation**: Calculate Yellow Network tokens to return
3. **Fee Deduction**: 10% fee applied to return amount
4. **Token Burning**: Tokens burned from seller's address
5. **Collateral Reduction**: Total price deducted from token's collateral
6. **Payment**: Net amount (after fee) sent to seller

### Phase 2: Token Graduation to DEX

#### 2.1 Graduation Trigger
```solidity
if (tokenData[_token].collateral >= graduationAmount) {
    graduateToken(_token);
}
```

**Graduation Conditions:**
- **Collateral Threshold**: 0.005 Yellow Network tokens accumulated
- **Automatic Trigger**: Happens immediately after any trade that crosses threshold
- **One-Time Event**: Token can only graduate once

#### 2.2 Graduation Process
```solidity
function graduateToken(address _token) internal
```

**Detailed Graduation Steps:**

1. **DEX Pair Creation:**
   ```solidity
   address pool = yellowDexFactory.createPair(_token, yellowDexRouter.WETH());
   ```
   - Creates liquidity pair on Yellow DEX
   - Token paired with Yellow Network's native token (WETH equivalent)

2. **Transfer Enablement:**
   ```solidity
   token.enableTransfers();
   ```
   - Removes transfer restrictions
   - Token becomes freely tradeable

3. **Liquidity Provision:**
   ```solidity
   token.mint(address(this), (maxSupply * 20) / 100);  // 20% of max supply
   token.approve(address(yellowDexRouter), (maxSupply * 20) / 100);
   yellowDexRouter.addLiquidityETH{value: (graduationAmount * 98) / 100}(
       _token,
       ((maxSupply * 20) / 100),
       0, 0,
       address(0),
       block.timestamp
   );
   ```

   **Liquidity Distribution:**
   - **20% of Max Supply**: Tokens provided to DEX liquidity pool
   - **98% of Graduation Collateral**: Yellow Network tokens provided to pool
   - **2% of Graduation Collateral**: Sent to token creator as reward

4. **State Update:**
   ```solidity
   tokenData[_token].stage = TokenStages.GRADUATED;
   ```

**Economic Impact of Graduation:**
- **Liquidity Pool**: Ensures immediate trading capability on DEX
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven pricing replaces bonding curve
- **Creator Reward**: 2% of graduation collateral incentivizes quality token creation
- **Platform Revenue**: 98% of collateral provides DEX liquidity

## ⚔️ Battle System Architecture

### Phase 3: Token Battles

#### 3.1 Battle Creation
```solidity
function createBattle(address _token1, address _token2) external payable
```

**Battle Requirements:**
- **Fee**: 0.0002 Yellow Network tokens per battle
- **Token Status**: Both tokens must be `GRADUATED`
- **Supply Check**: Each token must have ≥ 1000 tokens in circulation
- **Cooldown**: 10-minute cooldown between same token pair battles
- **Different Tokens**: Cannot battle the same token against itself

**Battle Creation Flow:**
1. **Validation Checks**: All requirements verified
2. **Battle Initialization**: New battle struct created with:
   - Token addresses
   - Start time (current block timestamp)
   - End time (start + 10 minutes)
   - Zero initial votes
   - Unsettled status
3. **Stats Update**: Battle participation tracked for both tokens
4. **Event Emission**: `BattleCreated` event with battle details

#### 3.2 Voting Mechanism

**Anti-Whale Voting Power Calculation:**
```solidity
function calculateVotingPower(address _voter, address _token1, address _token2) 
    public view returns (uint256) {
    MemedToken token1 = MemedToken(_token1);
    MemedToken token2 = MemedToken(_token2);
    
    uint256 token1Balance = token1.balanceOf(_voter);
    uint256 token2Balance = token2.balanceOf(_voter);
    
    // Square root prevents whale dominance
    uint256 power1 = sqrt(token1Balance);
    uint256 power2 = sqrt(token2Balance);
    
    return power1 + power2;
}
```

**Voting Process:**
```solidity
function vote(uint256 _battleId, address _votingFor) external
```

**Step-by-Step Voting:**
1. **Time Validation**: Battle must be active (between start and end time)
2. **Duplicate Prevention**: User can only vote once per battle
3. **Token Validation**: Must vote for one of the battling tokens
4. **Power Calculation**: Voting power = sqrt(token1_balance + token2_balance)
5. **Vote Recording**: Votes added to respective token's total
6. **Stats Update**: Total votes tracked for leaderboards
7. **Event Emission**: `VoteCast` event with voting details

**Anti-Whale Benefits:**
- **Square Root Function**: Reduces impact of large token holders
- **Fair Distribution**: Small holders have proportionally more influence
- **Prevents Manipulation**: Large holders cannot dominate voting

#### 3.3 Battle Settlement

**Settlement Process:**
```solidity
function settleBattle(uint256 _battleId) external
```

**Settlement Logic:**
1. **Time Check**: Battle must have ended (current time ≥ end time)
2. **Winner Determination**: Token with more votes wins
3. **Tie Breaking**: If votes equal, random winner based on block timestamp
4. **Stats Update**: Wins, losses, and monthly data updated
5. **King System**: Check for new "King" token (3+ wins in current month)

**Winner Determination Algorithm:**
```solidity
if (battle.token1Votes > battle.token2Votes) {
    winner = battle.token1;
    tokenStats[battle.token2].totalLosses++;
} else if (battle.token2Votes > battle.token1Votes) {
    winner = battle.token2;
    tokenStats[battle.token1].totalLosses++;
} else {
    // Tie breaker: random selection based on block timestamp
    winner = battle.token1Votes == 0 ? address(0) : 
            block.timestamp % 2 == 0 ? battle.token1 : battle.token2;
}
```

#### 3.4 King System & Leaderboards

**King Crowning Logic:**
```solidity
if (monthlyWinCount[winner][(block.timestamp / 30 days) % 6] >= 3 && 
    winner != currentKing) {
    currentKing = winner;
    winnerStats.isKing = true;
    winnerStats.kingCrownedTime = block.timestamp;
    emit NewKingCrowned(winner, block.timestamp);
}
```

**Leaderboard Generation:**
```solidity
function getLeaderboard(uint256 limit) external view returns (
    address[] memory tokens,
    uint256[] memory wins,
    uint256[] memory totalBattles,
    uint256[] memory totalVotes
)
```

**Leaderboard Features:**
- **Sorting**: Tokens ranked by total wins
- **Comprehensive Stats**: Wins, battles, votes tracked
- **Configurable Limit**: Return top N tokens
- **Real-time Updates**: Stats updated after each battle

- **Security Enhancement**: Prevents front-running and manipulation
- **Scalability**: Efficient verification of complex conditions

**Proof Verification:**
```solidity
function verifyProof(
    uint256[8] calldata proof,
    uint256[1] calldata input
) public view
```

**Technical Implementation:**
1. **BN254 Curve**: Elliptic curve for cryptographic operations
2. **Groth16 Protocol**: Zero-knowledge proof system
3. **Public Inputs**: Battle-specific parameters
4. **Private Inputs**: User's token holdings (kept private)

**Verification Process:**

## 🔄 Complete User Journey Examples

### Example 1: Token Creator Journey

**Step 1: Token Creation**
```
User Alice wants to create "DogeMoon" token
- Pays 0.002 Yellow Network tokens
- Provides metadata: name="DogeMoon", ticker="DOGE", description="To the moon!", image="https://..."
- Token deployed with address 0x1234...
- Initial state: BOUNDING_CURVE, 0 collateral, transfers disabled
```

**Step 2: Early Trading**
```
Users start buying DogeMoon tokens
- Initial price: ~0 (very low due to minimal supply)
- Each buy increases price linearly
- 10% fee applied to all trades
- Collateral accumulates: 0.001 → 0.002 → 0.003 Yellow Network tokens
```

**Step 3: Graduation**
```
After significant trading, collateral reaches 0.005 Yellow Network tokens
- Automatic graduation triggered
- DEX pair created: DogeMoon/Yellow Network
- 200M tokens + 98% of collateral provided as liquidity
- Alice receives 2% of collateral as reward
- Transfers enabled, token freely tradeable
```

### Example 2: Battle Participant Journey

**Step 1: Token Acquisition**
```
User Bob buys graduated tokens
- Purchases 10,000 DogeMoon tokens
- Purchases 5,000 CatCoin tokens
- Both tokens are graduated and battle-eligible
```

**Step 2: Battle Creation**
```
Bob creates battle between DogeMoon and CatCoin
- Pays 0.0002 Yellow Network tokens fee
- Battle starts: 10-minute duration
- Both tokens have >1000 supply (eligible)
```

**Step 3: Voting**
```
Bob votes for DogeMoon
- Voting power = sqrt(10,000) + sqrt(5,000) = 100 + 70.7 = 170.7
- Anti-whale mechanism prevents large holders from dominating
- Vote recorded and added to DogeMoon's total
```

**Step 4: Battle Resolution**
```
After 10 minutes, battle settles
- DogeMoon receives 1,500 total votes
- CatCoin receives 1,200 total votes
- DogeMoon wins, stats updated
- Bob's tokens remain unchanged (voting doesn't consume tokens)
```
